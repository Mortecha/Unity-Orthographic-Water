Initially just grabbed the water shader out of 3deric's retro terrain project: https://github.com/3deric/retro_terrain as a means to apply to a number of projects I require water that works under orthographic projection. 

I found it accidently while working on a tycoon terrain like editor and since it's quite difficult to find a water shader that does this, I figured it's important enough to warrant it's own project. Every other water shader I've looked into only works under perspective projection and fails to render orthographically. 

Future plans
- Expand upon the shader to add features that are commonly found in other water shaders that only work under perspective projection. 
- Waves
- Improve visual bugs that can occur with subsurface objects or submerged portions of objects
